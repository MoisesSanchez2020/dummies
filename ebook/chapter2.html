        <p>That night was cold and foggy, and Charlie was waiting for Gonta to leave his house to this incredible adventure.
            They are the first to arrive at the Lonely bridge.
             
            Every child in the village had heard the story about Toyland, and the poorness was so great that not all children had toys or could buy them, some barely had food to eat so buying toys was the last thing they thought.
            A few minutes before midnight other children from everywhere began to come to wait for the trip of their lives.
            "What about if this is just a tale and         nothing else!" Charlie said.
            "Hey!"  
            "Don't you remember that my brother is there already," Gonta said.
            "True!" Charlie said.
            "It's almost midnight!" 
            
            </p>


            <p>"Did you hear that?" Gonta asked.
                "What!" Charlie asked. 
                "Wait that sound is! Like a circus!"
                "I love it!" Gonta said.
                All the children were shaking in the freezing night, but once they all heard the music, they just forgot.
                The circus music was getting closer, they barely saw anything, but there was a light that comes near to the music.
                It was not stronger music, but all the children could listen.
                "look!" Charlie is  Mr. toy!  wooow!" 
                Gonta said.
                "School bus!!!  Hahaha, that is fantastic!" Charlie Said.
                When the bus stopped on the lonely bridge, and the music was clear all the children stop talking and wait for the bus doors to open and let them in.
                The bus is painted it with all kinds of bright colors and neon lights, and an old fat clown Mr. Toys was driving the bus.
                Mr. Toy is how they call him, opened the bus door and barely said: "welcome aboard." All the children ran to get the best seat.
                When everyone was inside, and they sat. The strange circus music played again. And this time everyone acted as if they were sleeping
                but with their eyes open. they did not move or make any noise the bus vanished in the dark, foggy night.
                
                
    
    
            </p>
    
        <p>Those twenty-nine children boarded the bus and will always be missed.
            The next morning the bus stop and the music too, welcome to "El Pais de Los Juguetes,"
            The billboard at the entrance of the park announces it, a big clown face with the open mouth was the door, then all the children went through it.
            It was a shiny day all the children laughed and cheered everywhere, for Charlie was an incredible day.
            The park was a great place with wheels of fortune, great roller coasters, water slides, bumper cars, water rides, carousels, flying scooters, Swing Rides, train rides, all sorts of attractions.
             There were even places to eat and drinking Oasis with all kinds of refreshments.
             Candy shops, cotton candy, and balloons everywhere. All the children run, eat, drink, have a lot of fun.
            In the park, you could see children of all ages and races, and you could hear many
            children speak in different languages since they came from all over Europe.
            They ran and played, others ate and enjoyed all the attractions of the park.
            They did not have to make a line to wait to get on the rides.
            
            


        </p>
    
        <p>The park was so big that they did not need to do it because the park is designed so that nobody has to waste the Time waiting, the food at Toyland was delicious, and there were specific places to eat.
            The smell in the park was like cotton candy and the desserts they could eat were delicious.
            "Hey, Charlie!" Gonta shout.
            "don't you think this is the best day of our lives?"
            "Yeah!" "I love this place, no adults, no school, no rules," Charlie said.
            "Let's try the rollercoaster," Gonta said.
            "No!"  "I want to try the water slides." 
            "This is awesome!" Charlie said. 
              "I am a little hungry!" "Let's eat something in the food court!" Gonta says with joy.
            "Yes" "I'm starving!" Charlie responded
            Both friends play and eat for hours, and they tried every ride in the whole park.
            Children run through the park every few hours the park opens its doors to welcome more and more children of all ages and backgrounds from all of Eastern Europe.
            
            </p>
   
        <p>
            When night comes, some sleep in the cabins that are made to rest in the park's resting area.
 The only adult was the old clowns who walked cleaning and carrying the children who slept in the rides. There were also the dummies were large dolls serving food and drinks in the food court, They are also found in all the attractions, and they manage the control cabs.
Some dummies dressed as a police officer, and some as nurses or doctors.
They were helping the children who were injured in the games. The children thought it was great to have dummies instead of adults in the park.
Charlie was so tired and was looking for a place to sleep, that night he fell asleep on the carousel. Charlie woke up after a long nap, and he was a little surprised.
He was lying down and one of the cabins, and he thought how he had arrived! He was confused to be there.
Once he got out of bed, he started to look for food. But at the table, there was only one frozen green drink.
But he did not want it, and Charlie did not like the frozen drinks.
He left and started looking for his friends Gonta.

            </p>
    
        <p>The park was full of children, it is hard to find his friend.
            That Charlie was there was not that impressive anymore, he just wanted to go home.
             He went to looks at every ride, even in the water attractions but he could not find his friend.
            He recognized one of the children from his village, and he was by the food court he was drinking the ice green drink.
            He looks tired and strange as if he slept with his eyes open.
            Charlie asks if he had seen Gonta, but the boy points to the Dummies.
            "Have you seen Gonta?" Charlie asked.
            Point his finger at the Dummies police! Child pointing.
            "Do they know where Gonta is?"
            "What's wrong with you?"
            "Why you have not slept yet?"
            "Why do you drink so much this green drink?" Charlie asked confused.
            The boy  fell to the ground
            "Are you ok?"
            "Help!" Charlie screams.
            Once the child falls, a group of ten police dummies appear and take the child with them.
            "Hey, wait! Will it be okay? Where are you taking it?" Charlie asked
            
            </p>
   
        <p>Charlie stood still watching the dolls take the child to the white building. He wanted to know what would happen to the child and wanted to know what was in that place. Maybe his friend Gonta was there, and maybe the dummies had also taken him away.
            After a few hours waiting for the kid to come out, he realized he would not leave.
            His curiosity and his fear grew to know that it was the truth of Toyland and he thought that maybe he could never leave that place.
