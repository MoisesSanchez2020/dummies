        <p>Once upon a time in a faraway land in eastern Europe, there was a small village in the borders between Spain and Portugal. This town was closed to the black hills forest a place where people said was enchanted.
            The elders in the town tell all kind of stories to the children all around. Biona’s town is cold and foggy it gets dark early most of the time.
            School hours was the only time where you can find people in the streets, pretty much is not a social town for so many reasons. Very soon after the first world war started, the children of the city begin to disappear.
            Last year it was reported that one hundred and fifty children were missing. 
            It has been happening every year, almost twelve to fourteen  kids disappear from home nearly every month and some police reports
            said this is repeatedly happening for the past years.
            </p>


            <p>With the passing of the year's people move in and move out to this village, and all these stories kept like just that! Tales.
                It is an unfortunate community in the mountains, all the jobs are in the big city “Sagres” Eight hours away in bus.
                Most of the time the parents are absent from home during big part of the week.
                This town used to have happy and friendly
                 people, the local school of this community
                now is as empty as the rest of the city.
                Some of the last children in this sad and lonely place are walking to the school.  Charlie lives with his father in the big city of Sagres when Charlie turns ten years old, his father gave 
                him bad news, he decides to move back to his hometown Baiona’s on the border of Spain and Portugal. After the death of his mother in a car accident, Charlie's father decided to make a change in their lives, and they moved to start again with Charlie.
                It was a significant change for him, he would have to leave his friends and his neighborhood that reminded him so much of his mother.
                After they move to his father hometown Charlie tried to make new friends, one of his new pals is Gonta an eleven years old boy who lives with his grandmother. Gonta is one of those remaining children in town.
                He is wild and smart but careless about school.

        <p>Today on his way to school Charlie pick up Gonta who's waiting outside at his house, he tells his grandma. Charlie is here!.
            Hey! "Charlie, what's for lunch,?" Gonta asked
             "Mmm, you're hungry already?' Charlie asked with a smile.
            Gonta shrugged said. "You know me… always."
            "Hey," Charlie said. "Let's race to the bridge."
            "Catch me if you can!" yelled Gonta as he started sprinting down the sidewalk.
            "wait up!" called Charlie.
            Both of them race to the bridge surprisedly Charlie won the race he is fast for his age.
             Hey! Charlie asked, "Why there are so many toys below this bridge?"
             "How come you didn't hear about this when you move?" Gonta asked.
             "Nope"  "but I notice every morning we passed here," Charlie said.
            "well, dude these are from all those parents who missed their children," Gonta said.
            "What do you mean?" Charlie asked.
             "Bro!" "Have you notice that there are not so many kids in this town?" Gonta said.
             "Yes!" 
            "But I thought it was because this is a small town," Charlie said.
            </p>
   
        <p>"No ones wants to talk about this" Gonta said   "It's like the adults forget their children after a while"  the people in this town become selfless and quickly forget their missing children. It's like something in this town makes them cold feelings to the memories of their children and only ignore them.
            "But let me tell you this if I have the chance that all those kids had it, I will take it." Gonta said   “This town has been very affected by the great war, and the food is limited, more and more people disappear without a trace, large cities were destroyed by bombers planes. 
            Very soon this city will disappear, and maybe we will be invaded, and it will take us to those
            who survive to some concentration camps to die and be forgotten.”
             Gonta said.
            "Where are those children who left?" 
            Charlie asked.
             "If I tell you," Gonta said. "Promise me that you will come with me?" Gonta said. 
            "Sure," Charlie said. "But tell me!" Charlie said.
             "Mmm" "El País de Los Juguetes!" Gonta said.
            "What is the mean?" Charlie said.
             "Well I don't know Spanish," Gonta said.
              "But I know this" 
            "Is a place where you will have fun, and you can be happy forever!" Gonta said.
             "Without your parents!" Charlie asked.
            </p>
    
        <p>"Sure!" Gonta said.
            "No school, no time for sleep early, no vegetable, no showers! you can eat whatever you want, pizza!, candies!, ice cream
            of all the flavors! and guess what?"
             "Is free!" Gonta said. "Believe me, bro! That's the place to go."  "But you said you would come with me!" "You promise!" Gonta said.
             "What if the place is real?" "yes!" 
            Charlie said. “I'll go." 
            They arrived late to school, Mr. Truffy didn't care, he is happy to see them back.
             All the children are welcome, as it could be ther last time they see them.
            The love of the people hearts has vanished,
            these children are coming from broken families.
            There is no future for them, go to a fun place for them is a significant relief, a perfect getaway from their reality.
            The school used to have three hundred kids, at very different ages between five and twelve.
            But in the last years children disappear, it change everything at the school.
            The townies did not want to have more children because they all ran away from home or just disappear.
            The tale about "El Pais de Los Juguetes " began after one of those parents searched for their daughter and found small flyer with a
            special invitation to "El Pais de Los Juguetes." 
            </p>
   
        <p>Every child who wants to go to this beautiful place needs an invitation.
            "Gonta how come you didn't receive an invitation," Charlie asked.
           "I do not have one because I don’t have
           toys to ask for it," Gonta said.
           "Why you need toys?" Charlie asked
           "What I know is that if you want to go, you have to pack all your toys in a bag and put
           it on the Lonely bridge, as a sign of an offering.
           At midnight on the 1st Saturday of each month then when you got back to your house…
           You'll find an invitation in your bed that will appear magically, it will tell you are invited to the fields of Toyland.
           The next night you have to go back to the same place where you left the toys" Gonta said.
           "That sounds pretty dumb!" Charlie said. 
            "Dude my brother stole all my toys, and he    left me here without a chance to go," Gonta said.
           "A brother?" Charlie asked.  
           "Yes yes yes he tricks me!" Gonta said. 
           "I have toys!" Charlie said.
           "If we get an invitation we both can go!" 
           Gonta said.
           "Great! Tomorrow is the first Saturday of November" Charlie said.
           "Pack all of them and meet me at the lonely bridge, we'll do it together," Gonta said.
           </p>
   
        <p>"Ok," Charlie said. 
            Don't fall asleep" Gonta said.
            "Nah… you too!" Charlie said.
            The next day after school Charlie packs all his toys in a paper bag, eats dinner with his father. He and his Dad exchange stories about this town, his father was a child that spend his childhood all over around the Black hills mountains.
             He did not think this could be the last time he could see his father again.
            This night Charlie when to bed around 8:30 pm with his bag of toys next to him, waiting for the clock to mark midnight.
            Knock knock!!!  Someone was knocking Charlie's window.     
            Charlie wakes up!  Gonta is super excited to receive the invitation, both run to the Lonely bridge with the bag of toys.
            The toys are the signal alert for Mr. Toy where he could find children to take it away.
            The toys are place it in the right spot, both run back to Charlie's house, once they get home they sneak up to his room and found a great surprise …“nothing!”.
            Gonta left with sadness and hopelessness.
            </p>
   
        <p>The next day, Charlie wakes up turn his head at the door of his room. He sees a card with a golden letter. It says "You are invite to the magic fields of Toyland, we will wait for you tomorrow night to board the magic bus that
            will take you to a wonderful place of endless joy" Mr. Toys will be waiting to take you to the ride of your life.
            He is su very surprise!. Later that morning Charlie is waiting for Gonta to pick him up, he got a big smile this morning. 
            "Why you are so happy…there's no reason for it"  "I hate this morning!" Gonta screams.
            "Close your eyes and make a wish" 
            Charlie said.
            "Ok but if there is not an invitation… I will not be happy!" Gonta said.
            When Gonta opens his eyes, he begins to laugh and shout as if no one ever smiled. 
            Finally, both received an invitation to Toyland.
