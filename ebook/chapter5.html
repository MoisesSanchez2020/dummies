        <p> After running non-stop for so many hours, Charlie finally faints hitting the ground and losing all his strength mentally and physically.
            A few days later, Charlie woke up in a hospital bed, a policeman found him on the deadly road next to the Black Hills forest.
            Where many children reported missing near the mountains. Charlie was lucky To be seen. 
            Charlie did not know where he was the next morning
            "Excuse me!" Charlie asked.
            "Hello!"  Nurse smile.  
            "Good Morning!"
             "Are you hungry?"  "It's been a time for you!"  Nurse asked.
             "Yes!"  Charlie answer. "I'm starving!"
            "Where am I?" Charlie asked.
            
            
            </p>


            <p>"You are at the Hospital of Lisbon!" Nurse said.
                "Lisbon!!!" "Wait for Portugal!" Charlie exclaim.
                "Yes!" Nurse answer.
                "I'm from Vigo!" Charlie said.
                Nurse - Spain!
                "How did you get here? "
                "Did you get away from home?"
                "Where are your parents?"  Nurse asked.
                "I live with my father, and my mother is dead!" Charlie answer.
                "When the police came, tell them what happened to you! And they'll take you home, or you'll get in touch with your father," exclaimed the nurse.
                Later that day some detectives visit the hospital, they are looking for Charlie, the nurse takes them to his room, he was eating his dessert next to the window.
                "Hello, Charlie! Detective 1 greets.  "How are you?"
                "Have you rested a bit?"  Detective 2 asked.
                "Charlie!" The nurse is asking for attention.
                "This gentleman wants to ask you some questions" Nurse said.
                "I'll be here with you!" 
                "Just in case you need anything!" Nurse said.
                "Sure!" Charlie said.   "I'm fine, just tired."
                "Have you run away from home?  Detective 1 asked.
                
                
    
    
            </p>
    
        <p>"No" Charlie responded. 
            Detective 2: Have you been kidnapped?
             "No" Charlie responded.
            "Did your father sell you?" Detective 1 asked.
            "No!" "My father loves me!" Charlie responded. 
            "How do you explain that you are five hundred miles from your home?" 
            Detective 2 asked.
            "I took the bus!" Charlie responded.
            "Ha ha ha!  the bus!" Detective 1 laughs.
             "It's impossible, and there are no buses from Vigo to Lisbon, it will take five days to arrive, even harder to reach the Black Hills Forest Mountain where they found you.
             The mountain is forbidden, and many children disappear!" Detective 2 explain.
            "Tell us about the bus you take!" Detective 1 asked.
            "My friend Gonta and I took the bus at midnight by the Lonely bridge in our hometown! " Charlie answer.
            "Where were you going?"  Detective 2 asked.
             "Toyland!" Charlie said.
            "That's an old story!"  Detective 1
            "No, it's real, and I escaped!" Charlie said.
            "My grandmother used to tell me those stories.
            It's not real!"  Detective 2 said.
            "Charlie!" "We want to help you, but we need the truth!"  Detective 1 said.
            "Who drove the bus?"  Detective 2 asked.
            "He was a big fat clown, there was more in the park, these clowns are in charge of the
            transportation, and even the Dummies obey
            them!" Charlie said.
            "Charlie, you must be tired, you are saying crazy things!" Nurse exclaim.
            "Dummies, haha!"  Detective 1 laughs.
            "Wait!"  "Tell me more!"  Detective 2 said.
            "He needs to rest now!" The nurse tells the Detectives.
            "You need to help them! All those children
            Will become dummies!" Charlie tells the Detectives.
            
            
            


        </p>
    
        <p>"Stop! Do not lie anymore!" Nurse raise the voice.
            "I guess we have to go!"  Detective 2 said.
            "Tomorrow, Charlie, you will take the train, we will contact your dad, he will be waiting for you
            at the Vigo train station, do not try to escape again!"  Detective 1 explains.
            "We'll drop you off at the train station!" Detective 2 said.
            "Thanks for coming!"
            "You see he's not ready to talk about this inconvenience!"
            "See you tomorrow!" Nurse said.
            The detectives leave the room so that Charlie recovers well for his trip back home.
            "You must sleep well, and you must forget all this!"
             "The nurse left the room, and Charlie fell asleep that night!" Nurse said.
            The next morning he woke up waiting for the two detectives to come, and take him to the train station.
            No one appeared another nurse named “Ana” let him go with instructions to the station. He went to the box office for his train ticket.
             When the train came, and the doors opened, he saw the nurse who had been kind to him.
            
            </p>
   
        <p>This time she was not wearing her uniform, had beautiful long blond hair, her skin was so white, and her beautiful green eyes, her red lips were different from other women, it was impossible not to see it. She comes near to Charlie, and he was happy to see a familiar face, she carries two large paper bags.
            "Charlie!"  Nurse exclaims.
            "Hello!"  "I'm going home now!" Charlie said.
            "I want to tell you something, but I want you always to remember It.!" Nurse said.
            "Ah!" "Yes, I will do it!" Charlie said
            "This time I spare your life, but I will not do it again.”
            She opened the paper bags, and they were dummies in each of those paper bags that were dressed in the clothes of the detectives the day before! They have a smaller size than usual since they fit in the paper bags.
            Charlie was scared! She closed the bag and threw it in the trash, then walked away.
            "What is your name?" Charlie whispers. 
            She gets closer to Charlie and whispers in his ear softly  “I will spare your life this time, but never say a word My name is Blair and never forget my name. “
            She walks away, and Charlie does not look back. He gets on the train, takes a seat and the train leaves the station.
            
           

            </p>
    
        <p>After a few days on the train, after a long journey, Charlie finally arrives at his destination.
            It was a cold and rainy day for Charlie
            Time passed like a blink of an eye, and his
            father was waiting for him at the train station.
            "My son, I miss you!"  His father hugged him.  "Are you ok? " Dad asked.
            But Charlie did not say anything, and he was
            like a zombie. Something changed in Charlie! his father saw that his mood changed, but his love for his son was too big. So he took him home, happy to finally find him.
            It's been two months since Charlie returned home, It seems that the time in Toyland is different than in the real world, for him it was two nights, but for the rest of the people, it was two months that they had disappeared.
            Nothing is the same for him.
            He walks alone to school, does not go out
            to play or is seen talking to someone.
            People ask him if he knows where all those children who disappeared are?.
            He does not say a word, he is terrified to say something and that Blair can look for him and turn him into a Dummy. One day he and his father were walking on the lonely old bridge when this old woman took him by the arm.
            
            
            </p>
   
        <p> "Charlie!", "where's Gonta?"
            "Please tell me where to find it!"  Old lady.
            Charlie - start to cry! Sorry, I could not help him.
            He took his father's hand and did not stop crying, that was the first time since his return that he said something.
            When they got home, Charlie told his father to tell him what had happened. He said his dad that he is terrified of Blair, but it was time to 
            tell him what had happened
            "Dad, I was in Toyland!" Charlie said.
             "Toyland!" Dad said.
            "Yes daddy!" Charlie ensures. 
             "El País de Los Juguetes"  "Son!" 
            "That's a story my grandmother used to tell me when I was disobedient," She tried to scare me by telling me that Toyland was a wrong place, but all the children of the town wanted to go.
             Dad said.
            "Dad is true!" 
            "Everything people say is true, toys, bus, clowns, rides, food, everything is true!" 
            "But this is what nobody knows!" Charlie said.
            "What is that?"  Dad asked.
            "After a couple of days in Toyland
             You'll become a dummy, and they'll sell you!" Charlie said.
            "How do you become a dummy?" Dad asked.
            
            
           </p>
           <p>"There's a green drink that everyone drinks, I saw kids turn into toys!"
            "It's like a toy factory they're just waiting for the kids to change so they can sell them!"
            "Clowns are working there, and they are fat and olds, those are the only adults there and the dummies!" "Those are different, they are strong and bigger, but they obey the clowns!" 
            The children who arrive there never leave, they become dummies and sell them in the big toy stores of the big cities.
            These children become toys and never come back.  Charlie explains.
            "How did you get away from that place?" 
            Dad asked
            "Daddy, I do not like sugar, that's why I did not take the green juice, so I planned how to escape when everyone was having fun!"
            "I lost Gonta there!" Charlie feels guilty.
            "I did not see him again, and I think now he's a dummy!"
            "We need to get back daddy!" Charlie asked.
            "Why!" Dad asked.    "You are safe now."
            "How do you think all these parents feel?"
            "I know how to get in and how to get out, we need a plan and free those kids.
            "Dad, you would help me?" Charlie asked.
            "I lost so many friends at school, even my cousin Suzy disappeared!"
            "Let's do it, son, but we need a plan!"
            </p>
            <p>"No one ever escapes, so they will not be waiting for us!" Dad said.
                "Dad!" Charlie exclaims. "There's a lady in the hospital who told me to forget everything or she would take my life!" Charlie said.
                "Who was it?" Dad asked.
                "Her name is Blair, and she was a nurse!" Charlie said.
                "I do not think she was a real nurse!"
                "Did you see her in the Toyland?"  Dad asked.
                "No!" Charlie answer.
                "Maybe she was a stranger!" Dad said.
                "She was beautiful!" Charlie said.
                "If we go! son, we might not come back!"
                "We do not want more children to lose their lives!" Dad said.
                "We have to do it, Dad!" Charlie said.
                "Ok let's go!" Dad said.
                "But first let's make a plan tell me how to get there!" “Charlie also gave him all the details of the white building he remembered.”
                This time he did not need a golden ticket because he knew the time and place where he should go.
                Both got ready that night, waited for midnight to approach.
                Then they went to the Lonely bridge, saw some children walking the streets but they did not say anything because they needed to go with them.
            </p>
            <p>they arrived at the bridge and waited for them to pick them up to go to Toyland
                Charlie's father tells him to go and join the group. 
                He would hide in the darkness hoping he would not be seen.
                Charlie was impatient and afraid that the fat old clown driver would recognize him.
                It was a cold night, and the children were excited. Except for Charlie, he knows what will happen to them if they do not stop this madness.
                Midnight! said one of the children, some lights on the road announce the arrival of the mysterious bus that will take them all to Toyland.
                The bus arrived in the middle of the night, and it was a foggy night like the last time.
                Children were so happy at this moment and were nervous and afraid to know that his
                Dad will rescue him if something happens to him.
                The bus stops at the Lonely bridge, the doors open the music starts playing. 
                The old fat clown said "welcome to Toyland welcome."
                


            </p>
            <p>
                All the children run to sit, and Charlie turns his head looking for his father but does not see him. 
He gets on the bus pretending to be excited, went to the back of the bus looking through the windows.
The bus begins to move the music starts to play, Charlie was desperate to see his dad.
The children on the bus began to lose control, and one by one they went into a trance because of the music, Charlie knew that soon he would lose his head.
Something caught his attention! Something in the dark! It's Charlie's dad running behind the bus.
He runs so fast that he was able to grab the bars at the back of the bus, and climb to the roof and hold on tight, hoping he would not fall.


            </p>
            <p>Charlie breathes deeply because his father was on the bus, soon he finally went into a trance and lost his head like everyone else
                trance and lost his head like everyone else on the bus, except the old fat clown.
               Charlie's father was at the top of the bus, and he also listens to the music, but maybe it has not affected him because it only works with children.
               He saw the lonely bridge disappear when the bus crossed the fog and appeared near other
               cities and so it was all night.
               The fog was a magical transporter, that's how the bus was able to cross all those cities and valleys across Eastern Europe on the same night.
               Charlie's father was surprised at what was happening, after so many stops the bus stopped on a dark road next to the mountains, he could not recognize the place because they came to the enchanted lands of Toyland.
               He Looks towards the horizon and saw the lights announcing the place when the bus was approaching the entrance.
               

            </p>

            <p>He could hear the children laughing and screaming before the bus stopped Charlie's dad
                jump from the roof of the bus.
                He ran trying to hide in the darkness next to the walls of Toyland, where there was
                no light, he found a place where he could see the bus driver and the children get off the bus.
                The music on the bus stops, all the kids start screaming for the thrill of being in this fantastic place, Charlie woke up knowing that the end of his last adventure would soon come.
                He left the bus with all the kids excited, and they run towards the big clown face entrance.
                Charlie sauntered thinking and looking for where his father could it be before entering
                he saw his father! Behind the bus trying to come without being seen.
                Charlie went ahead with his plan, immediately entered pretending to be happy with the other children. His father was on the bus waiting for the fat old clown to make a move.
                Finally! After all the children entered the park, the fat clown got off the bus, when Charlie's dad hit him on the head. He quickly took off his clown clothes and hid the fat clown while the bus was parked.
                

            </p>
            <p>Slowly he drove the bus to the garage, and everything was with the light off, but as
                soon as he entered the garage, the lights 
                went on.
                He saw a group of dummies waiting for him to park, he was impatient because he remembered
                what his son had told him and he knew that everything was real.
                He parked next to other buses, and he was nervous getting off the bus. When he got off the bus he tried to act like the old fat clown would and go unnoticed.
                The Dummies did not recognize him, and it could be because he was dressing like the fat clown.
                He put on some extra clothes to look fat, so they do not realize, the dummies are
                waiting for him, and they take him inside the white building.
                He counted six dummies around him, three on his right and three on his left, walk and enter a
                big room. Charlie's dad quickly grabbed the heads of the dummies and hit them with each other, the rest of them reacted to see what happened.
                

            </p>
            <p>Charlie's father kicks one of them with such force that his head explodes, leaving him lying on the floor. The dummies have green gelatin inside or something like that.
                He takes two of his legs and hits them against the wall exploding his head, one of them bites him in the leg and the other bites his arm.
                Charlie's father knew he had to destroy those dummies or someone would realize there was
                an intruder in the park.
                He kicks the head of the dummy that bites him
                on his leg! He jumps on his head, and the one that bit his arm hits him against the walls. He knew someone would come to check on them for the big fight that had happened and the noise they made.
                Quickly after finishing the big fight that just happened, he ran down the hall opening all the doors looking for the lab, but all those rooms were full of dummies ready to be sent.
                Finally, he opened the last door at the end of the hall and was impressed by the amount of green juice they were doing in that lab. 
                He entered the room and closed the door, he soon heard the sound of footsteps marching and became frightened, he took a chair and
                knocked on the door. He started beating and breaking all the containers and the laboratory equipment where they cooked the green juice and set the laboratory on fire. 
                

            </p>

            <p>
                He let the gas out of the burners in the kitchen to burn everything quickly.
The green liquid begins to burn super fast, and the dummies hit the door trying to throw it away. Charlie's dad broke all kinds of containers that could have green juice, and the door was falling apart. The dummies were trying to open the door, more and more began to come to
demolish the door.
Charlie's father dipped a towel and covered his face so that the smoke would not kill him, sat
by the door and watched the whole laboratory burn entirely.
Outside in the park, Charlie ran to cross the park, passing through all the attractions it took him more than thirty minutes to get to the back of the park. He saw the white building at the end of the place with very smoke coming out.
He noticed that most of the dummies were running towards the white building, he thought that his father might be in trouble since it seems to be burning.
A large column of black smoke comes out of the entire building, and it is evident that the back of the park was burning.

            <p>All children were not paying attention to what was happening around them, some have already started the transition to becoming dummies.
                The dummies ran to the white building and did not pay attention to the children transformed they seemed very serious.
               So they ran to get to the white building, Charlie saw the opportunity to help his father, he went to the food court and saw
               that nobody was taking care of the kitchens and the ovens.
               He quickly let the gas out of all the stoves, soon all this area smelled of gas and closed all the doors of the kitchen.
               He ran out looking at the white building, saw that all the smoke and fire came out. He started to alert the children, and they started screaming and going crazy, the doors were open in the white building, and everything was a riot.
               Charlie's father knew he would die if he did not escape, opened the door and let the dummies enter.
               When they entered the fire it began to melt them, and some burned quickly, as they were wooden dummies they did not feel the heat of the fire, and they burned fast.
               Charlie's father as the door falls jumps over the burning dummies while the others try to stop the fire in the walls and the laboratory.
               

            </p>
        <p>The whole building burns in the fire, he runs to the exit to find Charlie. Boom !!! A massive explosion in the laboratory room destroys part of the building.
            The doors of the park open after the big
            explosion even at the main entrance opens
            Charlie's father comes out very disturbed and confused by the blast.
            The children in the park cried with fear because they did not know what to do or what was happening, the fun had ended the fire, and the explosion had changed everything.
            When many saw the main entrance open they just ran and escaped, some of them became dummies.
            It was a big disaster after the first explosion, when Charlie's father heard  Dad! Dad! I'm here.
            They both ran and embraced and cried for
            the happiness of seeing each other.
            In front of them a large group of dummies, stared at them while the rest of the park burned quickly.
            Charlie says to his father: We did it, dad!
            "Yes, Charlie!" Charlie's father said.
            They did not realize what was happening around them
            "But we have to escape now before they catch us!"
            both turn their heads towards the dummies
            "Wait, dad!" "Look at the food court!"
            "Will explode!" Charlie said.
            Now the dummies start running towards them when they pass through the food court. Charlie's father throws him to the ground trying to protect him from the dummies, a big bang! In the kitchen, it destroys all the dummies that crossed it. The loud explosion sweeps all the dummies, much of the park is destroyed and is on fire. After a few minutes of silence, Charlie  whispered! Dad, are you okay? Answered! his father "Yes."
            But my body hurts! Hahaha laughs by the emotion! 
            We have to leave this horrible place.
            

        </p>
        <p>
            Both walk in the park in search of children, but all they have only found dummies burned and destroyed.
The whole area was burning, and everything looks desolate! all those who could have escaped from the park.
Both walked all over the place and only saw it as ardiaToyland, they crossed the main entrance, and they walked away watching behind their backs, the billboard that said Toyland is burning.
They look towards the door, and a person was standing looking at them to get away from that damn place.
"Dad, did you see it!" Charlie asked. 
"Yes!"  Charlie's Dad answer. 
"Who's there?
"She is Blair, Dad …the nurse!” Charlie answer.
Both turn their heads and went home.
