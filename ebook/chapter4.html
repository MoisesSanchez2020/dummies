        <p>Charlie panic! I need to get out of here I have to tell my dad! Charlie exclaim.
            He left that evil room and returned in the same way.
             It was a sound that made him freeze and scare AHHHH! Shhh
            He entered the warehouse, he wants to see what the creepy sound was, there is a boy surrounded by dummies the boy was lying on the floor, one of the dummies is placed in front of the child open the mouth, and That horrible and strange sound comes out!  AAAAHHHHHH! Shhh
            A green smoke came out after the sound, the child screams at the same time it begins to shake. The child begins to change its form, hair, face, skin, size everything turns into that child “it becomes a dummy.”
            He stands as one of them!
            Apparently, that child had entered the white building without warning and had been
            discovered by the dummies.
             
            
            </p>


            <p>Charlie was in shock! Wants to leave that place of horror.
                Charlie silently looks for a way out, saw an opportunity at the back door, where the trucks arrive to pick up the mannequins, the roller door stays open for a few minutes.
                No one was watching, that was the time Charlie was looking. He waited another hour hiding behind the new delivery of dummies.
                The roller doors opened, the entire cargo
                the area was empty, and that was the opportunity that Charlie expected.
                "Aaahhh! That was close!"
                “Thank godnees they didn’t see me”
                "Now I need to escape from this place! " Charlie exclaim.
                Charlie looked for an exit around the whole place, but he couldn't find anything, it was full of children from all over Eastern Europe.
                He saw some very excited children talking about how beautiful that place was.
                "Hey, guys!" "When do you arrive," Charlie asked.
                 "Today!"
                 "We are so happy to be invited," Kid said.
                  "How do you get invited?" Charlie asked.  
                 "We found a flyer with the instruction at the school" kid answer. 
                 "How about you! Kid" asked.
                
                
    
    
            </p>
    
        <p> "My friend also found one!"
            "Did you guys take a bus to come here?" Charlie asked.
            "Yes, with the old fat clown driver " kid said.
            "Do you remember the trip or how long did it take?" Charlie asked.
            "Mmm! actually no" 
           "Soon the strange song begins, I do not remember anything" Kid said.
           "Where are you from?" Charlie Asked.
            "We are from milk town in Bratislava!" the kid said.
           "Wow! You are from Bratislava!" Charlie said.
           "I'm from a small village in Spain," Charlie said.
           "Nice! I see that!"
           "This place is amazing," the kid said.
           "How many in your group arrived?" Charlie asked.
           "We were a large group, like 100 children," Kid said.
           "Do me a favor! Do not drink the green juice!" Charlie asked.
           Charlie goes away hoping that these children do not become dummies.
           He returned to the highest Ferris wheel in the park he looks at the entrance to find out how to escape.
           Charlie pays attention to the doors, every time a new bus arrives they park on the right side of the park, and all children run towards the big
           clown face which is open as children come near.
           
            
            


        </p>
    
        <p>A group of dummies also welcomes you at the park gate. For Charlie, it will be tough to find the right time to escape without being seen, and no one ever escapes from Toyland.
            At night the lights at the entrance go out, the buses stop coming so often and start arriving every six hours, one at six in the afternoon, another at midnight and the last one at six in
            the morning, then at their regular hours every
            three hours.
            Charlie decides that tonight will be the best time to escape, his chances of not being noticed are higher.
            In the park, all children are more concentrated at night in the resting areas and the food court,  that is the time when more children became Dummies.
            Then all the attention will turn to those children, and It took more than a day for Charlie to figure out the time slots,  he was hungry and tired.
            He went to the food court to get some hot dogs and some pizza the food was delicious, but there was no drinks selection, just the green juice he does not want to take the risk.
            Charlie waits until the night comes when the lights go out, buses stop arriving so often.
            
            </p>
   
        <p>He went to one of the kiosks in the park looking for some paint, and He knew he could find a color that he could use. Some of the girls who were painting gave a little to him, blue, white and red.
            He put the paintings in his pocket and went to the bathrooms, made sure there was no one.
            With the paint, he painted his face until it looked like a dummy.
            Charlie looks like one of those dummies
            now, and he knew that his time would come soon.
            After painting his face, he finished his transformation, practiced his walking and his movements to be ready for his escape.
            He left the bathroom and went to the doors, almost midnight.
            All the attention began to focus on the food court and the rest areas, perfect for Charlie. He was standing in front of the doors when the dummies come to look for the new children
            They will escort them to the park it's five minutes until midnight. Charlie was
            impatient, but without any doubt, he hopes that when the bus stops and the children get off, he can escape.
            The bus has just announced its arrival, and the dummies come out to receive them.
             A group of ten were the total, and they were marching towards the doors.
            
           

            </p>
    
        <p>Charlie wipes the sweat from his forehead, went to the end of the Dummies line.
            None of them notice his presence, and They were like robots, they do what they do without speaking and without making any sound, maybe because he looks like them now. The door begins to open, Just in time Charlie hears the children's voice.
           It was a cold night with a lot of fog, almost the perfect night to escape from that terrifying place,  two dummies lines separated one and
           each side of the doors.
           Charlie was also moving, he was waiting for the right time, and Charlie saw one of the old clowns getting closer.
           The old clown wanted to greet the new children and welcome them.
           He walked very slowly, and he knew that if they recognized him, he would be in trouble, he looked like a dummy and acted like one of them.
           Children run through the big door with the mouth of clowns, Charlie runs.
           Wait! The clown exclaims! 
           He realizes that the boy was not a Dummy and that he is trying to escape, that was the moment that Charlie was looking.
           The clown saw it! Grab him! Grab him! He cannot escape!
           
            
            </p>
   
        <p> All the Dummies leave the position and run behind Charlie some dummies jump, but he ran as fast as he could. He crossed the door, and Charlie immediately felt himself battling some Dummies.
            These dummies were strong for their size, but they were still toys  Charlie managed to get out.
            But then he fought with three of them, grabbed one of them and threw him on the ground, and
            Charlie knew it was the only chance he had to
            escape otherwise he would become a Dummy forever.
            A dummy bites Charlie in the leg and kicks the other one, saw that they came close to him.
            He is scared! And throw the dummies down, run as fast as he can until the light goes out and goes away. Charlie escapes running nonstop.
            He never looked back and went on and on until he fell to the floor tired and crying, he could not believe what had happened to him. He just closed his eyes and fell asleep.
            The life of all those children will never be the same!
            Many parents wonder where Toyland children are missing.
