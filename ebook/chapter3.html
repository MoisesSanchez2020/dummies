        <p>Charlie decides to see how big that place was, so he gets into the biggest  Ferris wheels to see better. He was able to look at the walls, and was amazed at how big that place was.
            When he saw the strange looks of the white building in the back, he started to pay more
            attention to it, even a large parking lot for some large trucks is next to the warehouse.
            Other trucks left the area, although Charlie thought they could take the children to the hospital, there were no ambulances, only loading trucks.
            Charlie did not like it, the children still enter the park and get in the white building, but no one comes back to the park.
            While Charlie was on the ferry wheels thinking, he saw some kids drinking the
            green sodas.
            But something strange happens after the children drink the green soft drink.
             
            
            </p>


            <p>They all begin acting differently, they cannot stop drinking, they were dizzy and slippery, twenty minutes later they fall to the ground.
                At all the attractions, in the food court, and the park there were always dummies standing up as if they were controlling everything.
                When the children fell, a squad of dummies immediately picked them up and took them to the white building in the back.
                It happens almost every hour, and Charlie decides to sneak out to see what's going on and see where they take the children.
                 So he got off the Ferris wheel, went to the food court and pretended he was drinking the green soda.
                Charlie starts walking as if he is falling and shaking until he falls. After a few minutes, a squad of dummies went to look for Charlie.
                He was nervous, but soon the dummies picked him up. He closed his eyes until they were in front of the door of the white building.
                They all enter a large hall with a light at the end, and there was a large room with a large table with all kinds of dummies.
                They put Charlie next to other dummies, and they were like in the waiting room.
                The dummies squad throws Charlie, and they returned to the park.
                It seems that there were more children to collect
                 Charlie gets up and checks and touches the dummies next to him and realizes They are real wooden dummies.
                
                
    
    
            </p>
    
        <p>
            He did not understand how the children turned only by drinking the green juice.
All the dummies in the room were the size of the children according to the age and color of the skin.
 Charlie touched them to see if they were real wood and their Arms, legs, fingers, hair, dummies looked real, but they did not move.
There were dozens of boys and girls in the room. Charlie listened to the small steps that were approaching, quickly decided to hide 
under a table so as not to be discovered.
They were dummies with one of those fat old clowns who took the children to the buses.
"Oh! "
"Look these new dummies!" "They look good!" 
"We are going to make good money with these at the toy store."
"Ha hahaha! " the Old fat clown said.
"Hey! You Ozy "(this is the name that this fat old clown uses to call the dummies) get ready to pack these toys.
The truck will be here at midnight, and I do not want to be so late loading the truck." Old fat clown said.
The dummies obey the order without making any noise.

            
            


        </p>
    
        <p>They did not speak, but Charlie realizes that they were something different with these dummies.
            They dressed like adults and the size was a little bigger than the other dummies that were going to pack and send.
            "Mmm!" "Ozy wrap them up well, send them to Paris, looks good for a fancy store." Old fat clown said.
            Then the fat old clown leaves the room through the back door, and then Charlie sneaks out, the same way, they come out.
            He slowly opens the door and saw a big warehouse full of dummies wrap it and
            ready to be ship in the big trucks.
            Also, he saw the other dummies uploading the trucks.
            Charlie was frightened because he knew that if he did not escape he would become a dummy.
            He returned the same way, and he carefully opened door by door and a door that caught their attention.
             A green door and he decided to open it, what a surprise for Charlie! It was a laboratory.
            "Oh! What is this place?"
            "Looks like they're cooking something here!" Charlie said.
            He walked around the lab, looking for something to tell him what was going on or give him an idea of that place.
            
            </p>
   
        <p> There were many utensils and extensive amounts of ingredients like sugar, ice, pinewood.
            Charlie realized, this room is where the green drink is made. On the wall, there was a huge paper with some instructions.
            
            "This script seems like instructions, wait a moment these are the steps to make green 
            juice!" Charlie said.
            
            He starts reading the list of steps 
            1- Sugar, lots of sugar
            2 â€“ Pinewood.
            3 - Ice chopped.
            4 - Cherry Extract.
            5 - Lemon extract.
            6 - Kool-Aid Mix.
            7 - "Secret Ingredient."
            "Wait!" Charlie exclaims!
            "This is what makes the children change"  but what is the secret ingredient?.
            He looks for something that will lead him to know the secret ingredient but found anything.
